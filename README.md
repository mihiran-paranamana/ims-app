3. Spring Boot 2.4.5
4. Spring Boot JPA (Java Persistence API)
5. HATEOAS (REST APIs with Hypermedia)
6. Mysql 8.0
7. Docker + Docker Compose

### Install (on Ubuntu)

1. Install Docker and Docker Compose (Refer https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/ and https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).
2. Clone this repo (https://github.com/mihiran-paranamana/ims-app.git).
3. Move into the ims-app root folder (cd ims-app).
4. Run build script (sudo bash ./build.sh).
5. Run the installation script (sudo bash ./install.sh).
6. Browse http://localhost:4200/

* With the 4th step, It will create builds for the angular client app (inside ims-app/client/dist/client/) as well as the spring boot server app (inside ims-app/server/target/).
Also, it wll create a separate build folder located in the root folder with all the necessary build artifacts and final zip file (ims-stable-v0.0.1.zip).
* With the 5th step, It wil run "sudo docker-compose build" and "sudo docker-compose up -d" commands to up the containers.
* If you need to install the application with the final build (ims-stable-v0.0.1.zip) that has been generated by the "build.sh" script, first you can copy it into anywhere (even in another computer that has docker installed), then extract it, move to the root folder and run the "install.sh" script.
